Questions

1. What's the main reason that people leave a career in testing, according to the article? (Bear in mind it was written in 2000!) **Answer:**"Because software testing is sometimes viewed as a dead-end job, the most skilled testers are typically eager to “move up” and become programmers, analysts, or system architects." they mention in the begining of the article that there is this mentallity people have of testers being dev's who couldn't make it. that is probably why people think testing is lower rated and want to "move up" later on in their career.
1. What are the stages in their proposed career path for testers? **Answer:** The path starts off with an apprenticeship so the person may learn about the different directions in testing. the next level in the path is master. once the apprentice acquires there core skills they move up to the master level and become a full on software test engineer. after becoming a master, the person may further thier knowledge on a specific area and become a specialist. once they have become a specialist then then have the option to futher thier knowledge in a specific specialty or learn another specialty. making one of these changes would help them reach the next level and become a lead software test specialist. once the specialist acquires a vast breadth and deapth of knowledge they will reach the final level and be considered an enterprise tester.
